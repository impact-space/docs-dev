# 3. Functional Requirements

## 3.1 User Interface

The default LeptonX Lite theme provided by the ABP Framework will be used for the user interface. A project creation wizard will be implemented to guide users through the process of selecting project categories, tags, skills, skill groups, and organization members.

## 3.2 Accessibility 

While not a requirement for the MVP, the application will support accessibility for disabled users, adhering to relevant guidelines and best practices, such as screen reader support and keyboard navigation.

## 3.3 Future Integration Considerations 

The application will be designed with future integrations in mind, such as NextCloud and Element (Matrix) for document sharing and real-time communication.

## 3.4 Organization Member Management 

Organization members can be added manually by non-tenant system administrators, and admins and managers can add organization members to projects.

## 3.5 File Uploads 

Tenant users can upload images or documents for organization and project profiles, with a file size limit of 5GB for future versions.

## 3.6 Project Categories, Tags, and Required Skills 

Project categories, tags, and required skills will be implemented, with skills grouped by skill groups. Non-tenant system administrators can add or modify skills and skill groups, and managers and admins of tenants can add project categories and tags.

## 3.7 Pagination 

Pagination will be implemented for search results and organization or project listings, allowing for additional filter parameters.

## 3.8 Visibility and Featured Projects 

Projects can be set as public or private, and tenants and organizations can flag projects as "featured" for the public-facing website.

## 3.9 CMS and Public-Facing Website 

A custom-built public-facing website will display project profiles as a separate entity based on the provided data models. The layout and design will be developed in the milestones following the MVP release.

## 3.10 Error Handling and Exceptions 

Exceptions will be thrown during the process of adding, updating, and deleting entities, and other exceptions will be handled by the default ABP Framework and shown to the user in the presentation layer.

## 3.11 Monitoring and Logging 

Azure monitoring tools will be used for logging, monitoring, and analytics in the application.

## 3.12 Backups and Disaster Recovery 

Backup and disaster recovery requirements will be determined at a later date.

## 3.13 Project Management 

Projects can be created, edited, and deleted by system administrators (non-tenant admins), administrators, and managers. Each project will have a title, description, start date, end date, and status (e.g., Draft, InProgress, Completed, or Cancelled).

## 3.14 Task Management (Quest Actions) 

Quest Actions can be created, edited, and deleted within projects by tenant managers and admins, unless additional permissions are set for other members. Each Quest Action will have a name, description, status type (Draft, InProgress, Completed, or Cancelled), assigned date, due date, priority level, quest, budget, completed date, estimated effort, organization member activities, and tenant ID.

## 3.15 Notifications 

Notifications will be sent by default for the MVP. In future versions, users will be able to specify which notifications they want to receive by email.

## 3.16 User Roles and Permissions 

There will be different user roles within an organization, such as administrators, managers, and members. Each role will have specific permissions associated with it, determining what actions they can perform within the system. Admins can modify anything, while managers will be able to perform most actions.

## 3.17 Voting on Milestones 

Organization members will be able to vote on whether or not they want to work on milestones to help allocate budgets for specific milestones.
