## 2.1 Core Components

The Impact Space MVP will be developed using the ABP Framework, named "ImpactSpace.Core," and will be written in C#. The app will use a single-tiered Blazor Server app with Entity Framework Core, without a separated identity server or API.

## 2.2 User Registration and Authentication

User registration will be disabled for the MVP, and tenants will be added manually by non-tenant system administrators. User authentication and authorization for tenants will be implemented using ABP Framework's built-in features.

## 2.3 Role-Based Access Control

Role-based access control will be implemented for organization members, with Admin, Manager, and Contributor roles for tenants. Custom permissions will be set to allow specific users to add/edit/modify the various domain entities within the app.

## 2.4 Organization and Project Profiles 

Tenants will be able to create and manage organization profiles, ensuring unique organization names system-wide. Tenants can also create, edit, and showcase projects on a custom-built, separate public-facing website, including a main image, name, description, required skills, and tags. The layout and design of the public-facing website will be developed in the following milestones after the MVP.

## 2.5 Search Functionality 
Tenant users can search for projects within an organization, filter by name, categories, tags, and required skills.  

## 2.6 Dashboards

Dashboards will be implemented for tenants to have an overview of their organization and projects. A centralized dashboard will be created for non-tenant administrators to manage and monitor system-wide settings, such as skills and skill groups.

## 2.7 File Storage and Constraints 

Azure Storage will be used for file storage without using the ABP Framework's virtual storage module. File type constraints will be set based on the types of files to be uploaded to projects and organizations. For the MVP, storage limits will not be set, as there is only one organization (ProgCode) and storage will be internally monitored. In future versions, a limit of 5GB per tenant will be implemented.

## 2.8 Localization 

The application will initially support English language localization, with plans to support Spanish and German in the future.
