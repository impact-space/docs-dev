# 4. Non-Functional Requirements

## 4.1. Usability
The system will be designed with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily navigate and understand its features. The user interface will be visually appealing, and it will provide feedback to the user when actions are performed.

## 4.2. Reliability
The system will be designed to ensure a high level of reliability, minimizing the risk of failures and downtime. Regular backups will be performed to ensure data is preserved in case of any system issues. The system will be built on a robust and reliable infrastructure to provide consistent performance.

## 4.3. Maintainability
The system will be designed for easy maintenance and updates. It will follow a modular architecture, allowing for the easy addition, modification, or removal of features. Adequate documentation will be provided for developers to understand the system architecture and code base, facilitating future maintenance and updates.

## 4.4. Scalability
The system will be designed to handle a growing number of users and projects over time. The infrastructure will be able to support increased workload and data storage requirements as the system scales. Performance optimization will be a priority to ensure the system remains responsive and efficient as the user base grows.

## 4.5. Supportability
The system will offer support to users through user guides, video tutorials, and other documentation. In future versions, webinars or conferences may be held to provide additional support and guidance to users.

## 4.6. Security
The system will be designed to provide a secure environment for user data and project information. Access controls will be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions. Data encryption will be employed to protect sensitive information, both in transit and at rest. Regular security updates and vulnerability assessments will be conducted to maintain a high level of security.

## 4.7. Interoperability
The system will be designed to support interoperability with other tools and systems that the organization may use. This will allow for seamless data exchange between the different systems and make it easier for users to access and share information.

## 4.8. Accessibility
The system will be designed to be accessible for users with disabilities, ensuring that it complies with accessibility standards and guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This will ensure that the system can be used by a wide range of users, including those with visual, auditory, or cognitive impairments.

## 4.9. Notifications
The system will provide notifications to keep users informed about updates and changes to their projects, milestones, and other relevant information. Users will be able to customize their notification preferences, choosing which notifications they want to receive by email. In future versions, a notification icon will be added to the presentation layer to provide an additional way for users to view notifications.
