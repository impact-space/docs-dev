# 5. User Interface Design

## 5.1. User Interface Principles
The user interface design will adhere to the following principles:

- Clarity: The interface will be simple, clean, and easy to understand.
- Consistency: The interface will be consistent with the ABP Framework LeptonX Lite theme, ensuring a uniform look and feel across the application.
- Feedback: The interface will provide feedback to users through appropriate messaging and visual cues.
- Efficiency: The interface will be designed to minimize the number of clicks and steps required to complete tasks.
- Accessibility: The interface will support screen readers and keyboard shortcuts to ensure a good experience for users with disabilities.

## 5.2. User Interface Layout
The user interface layout will be based on the ABP Framework LeptonX Lite theme, with a few customizations:

- A new logo will be created and incorporated into the header.
- The main navigation menu will be located on the left side of the screen, providing easy access to the different sections of the application.

For the dashboard and overview pages, we suggest the following layout:

- A summary section at the top, displaying key metrics and information related to the user's projects and organizations.
- A list or grid view of the user's projects, with options to filter and sort them based on various criteria.
- A section displaying the latest activities, updates, and notifications related to the user's projects and organizations.

## 5.3. User Interface Navigation
Navigation within the application will be simple and intuitive. The main navigation menu will provide access to the most important sections of the application, such as projects, organizations, and user profile settings. Contextual menus and buttons will be used to provide quick access to relevant actions and features.

## 5.4. User Interface Components
The user interface will utilize standard components provided by the ABP Framework LeptonX Lite theme, such as buttons, input fields, dropdowns, and modals. These components will be used consistently throughout the application to ensure a cohesive user experience.

## 5.5. Accessibility
The user interface will be designed to be accessible for users with disabilities. It will support screen readers and include keyboard shortcuts for common actions. Proper semantic markup, ARIA attributes, and accessible color contrast ratios will be employed to ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines.
